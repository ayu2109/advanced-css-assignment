        <h1>Apple Inc</h1>
        <p>
            Apple Inc., founded on April 1, 1976, by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne, is a multinational technology company headquartered in Cupertino, California. <br>
            Apple is renowned for its innovative consumer electronics, software, and online services, including the iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and Apple TV. <br>
            The company's success can be attributed to its commitment to sleek design, intuitive user interfaces, and seamless integration between hardware and software. <br>
            The Apple II was chosen to be the desktop platform for the first "killer application" of the business world: VisiCalc, a spreadsheet program released in 1979.[26] VisiCalc created a business market for the Apple II and gave home users an additional reason to buy an Apple II: compatibility with the office,[26] but Apple II market share remained behind home computers made by competitors such as Atari, Commodore, and Tandy.[28][29] <br>
            The Lisa division was plagued by infighting, and in 1982, Jobs was pushed off the project. The Lisa launched in 1983 and became the first mass marketed personal computer with a GUI, but was a commercial failure due to its high price and limited software library. <br>
            obs, angered by being pushed off the Lisa team, took over the company's Macintosh division. Wozniak and Raskin had envisioned the Macintosh as a low-cost computer with a text-based interface like the Apple II, but a plane crash in 1981 forced Wozniak to step back from the project. Jobs quickly redefined the Macintosh as a graphical system that would be cheaper than the Lisa, undercutting his former division. <br>
            The advertisement created great interest in Macintosh, and sales were initially good, but began to taper off dramatically after the first three months as reviews started to come in. Jobs had required 128 kilobytes of RAM, which limited its speed and software in favor of aspiring for a projected price point of $1,000 (equivalent to $2,800 in 2022). The Macintosh shipped for $2,495 (equivalent to $7,000 in 2022), a price panned by critics due to its slow performance. <br>
